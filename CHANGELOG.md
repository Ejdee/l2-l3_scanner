# Initial Release

## Functionality

- Discover available devices in a selected IP range on network layer 2 and 3
- Use ICMPv4 echo requests and ARP for IPv4
- Use ICMPv6 echo requests and NDP for IPv6
- Scan network interfaces

## Known Limitations

- Performance issues may occur on large IP ranges
- The scanner does not include itself in the results (since the assignment doesnâ€™t specify this)
